# Welcome to our Workshop of Data Capturing & Processing on 22nd Nov
**This is a list of the files we will use today.**

## Brave Browser

*It's the Browser we will use today. Other Chromium-based browsers may also be compatible, but the steps may be slightly different.*

Get it from [Brave Browser Official Website](https://brave.com "Brave Browser Official"). Or download the offline standalone installer for [Windows](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases/download/v1.32.106/BraveBrowserStandaloneSetup.exe "Windows Standalone Installer") or [macOS](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases/download/v1.32.106/Brave-Browser-x64.dmg "macOS Installer").

## Table Capture
*It's the Browser Extension we will use today. You'll need to unzip and load it in your browser.*

Get it from [this repo](https://github.com/tndgroup2/file/raw/main/TableCaptureUnlocked.zip "Table Capture Unlocked").
> This is not a completely free extension, the developer only provides basic features for the free version. For demonstration purposes, we provide here a temporary full version. If you need advanced features, please [get the original version here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/table-capture/iebpjdmgckacbodjpijphcplhebcmeop "Table Capture from Chrome Web Store") and buy it.
