# Welcome to our Workshop of Data Capturing & Processing on 22nd Nov
**This is a list of the files we will use today.**

## Brave Browser

*It's the Browser we will use today. Other Chromium-based browsers may also be compatible, but the steps may be slightly different.*

Get it from [Brave Browser Official Website](https://brave.com "Brave Browser Official"). Or download the offline standalone installer for [Windows](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases/download/v1.32.106/BraveBrowserStandaloneSetup.exe "Windows Standalone Installer") or [macOS](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/releases/download/v1.32.106/Brave-Browser-x64.dmg "macOS Installer").

## Table Capture
*It's the Browser Extension we will use today. You'll need to unzip and load it in your browser.*

Get it from [this repo](https://github.com/tndgroup2/file/raw/main/TableCaptureUnlocked.zip "Table Capture Unlocked").
> This is not a completely free extension, the developer only provides basic features for the free version. For demonstration purposes, we provide here a temporary full version. If you need advanced features, please [get the original version here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/table-capture/iebpjdmgckacbodjpijphcplhebcmeop "Table Capture from Chrome Web Store") and buy it.

## Microsoft Office Excel
*emmm... It's Excel.*
You should already have MS Excel, right? If you don't have it yet, don't worry, we've brought the Excel installation media for Windows PC. If you need to install on another computer after the workshop, please check [this page](https://icto.um.edu.mo/software/microsoft-office-365-proplus/ "Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus") provided by UM ICTO (UMPASS Login Required).
